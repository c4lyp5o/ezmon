## 📦 Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd ezmon
bun install
bun install:all   # Installs both server & client deps
```

---

## 🏗️ Development

Start development mode with live reloading:

```bash
bun dev
```

This concurrently runs:

* **Client:** React (`bun dev:client`)
* **Server:** Bun backend (`bun dev:server`)
* **Worker:** Background jobs (`bun dev:worker`)

---

## 🚀 Build & Production

### Build the frontend

```bash
bun build-client
```

### Run in production with PM2

```bash
bun start
```

PM2 manages all processes using the configuration in `ecosystem.config.js`.

Other PM2 commands:

```bash
bun stop      # Stop all apps
bun restart   # Restart all apps
bun logs      # Monitor logs in real-time
```

---

## 🐳 Docker

**Build the Docker image:**

```bash
docker build -t ezmon .
```

**Run the compose script:**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

* Frontend available at `/dist`
* Backend exposed on port `5000`
* PM2 manages all processes inside the container

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

* **Backend:** `.env` file for environment variables
* **PM2:** `ecosystem.config.js` for cluster/fork mode and environment-specific configs
* **Frontend:** `client/vite.config.js` for build and dev settings
